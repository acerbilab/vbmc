## What is it

> *What if there was a model-fitting method similar to Bayesian optimization (e.g., [BADS](https://github.com/lacerbi/bads)), which, instead of returning just the optimal parameter vector, would also return its uncertainty (even better, the full posterior distribution of the parameters), and maybe even a metric than can be used for Bayesian model comparison?*

VBMC is an approximate inference method designed to fit and evaluate computational models with a limited budget of potentially noisy likelihood evaluations (e.g., for computationally expensive models). Specifically, VBMC simultaneously computes:
- an approximate posterior distribution of the model parameters; 
- an approximation — technically, an approximate lower bound — of the log model evidence (also known as log marginal likelihood or log Bayes factor), a metric used for [Bayesian model selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor).

Extensive benchmarks on both artificial test problems and a large number of real model-fitting problems from computational and cognitive neuroscience show that VBMC generally — and often vastly — outperforms alternative methods for sample-efficient Bayesian inference [[1,2](#references)].

VBMC runs with virtually no tuning and it is very easy to set up for your problem (especially if you are already familiar with [BADS](https://github.com/lacerbi/bads), our model-fitting algorithm based on Bayesian optimization).

### Should I use VBMC?

VBMC is effective when:

- the model log-likelihood function is a black-box (e.g., the gradient is unavailable);
- the likelihood is at least moderately expensive to compute (say, half a second or more per evaluation);
- the model has up to `D = 10` continuous parameters (maybe a few more, but no more than `D = 20`);
- the target posterior distribution is continuous and reasonably smooth (see [here](https://github.com/lacerbi/vbmc/wiki#general));
- optionally, log-likelihood evaluations may be noisy (e.g., estimated [via simulation](https://github.com/lacerbi/ibs)).

Conversely, if your model can be written analytically, you should exploit the powerful machinery of probabilistic programming frameworks such as [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) or [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/).

## Installation

[**Download the latest version of VBMC as a ZIP file**](https://github.com/lacerbi/vbmc/archive/master.zip).
- To install VBMC, clone or unpack the zipped repository where you want it and run the script `install.m`.
   - This will add the VBMC base folder to the MATLAB search path.
- To see if everything works, run `vbmc('test')`.

## Quick start

The VBMC interface is similar to that of MATLAB optimizers. The basic usage is:

```matlab
[VP,ELBO,ELBO_SD] = vbmc(FUN,X0,LB,UB,PLB,PUB);
```
with input parameters:
- `FUN`, a function handle to the (unnormalized) log posterior distribution of your model (that is, log prior plus log likelihood of a dataset and model, for a given input parameter vector);
- `X0`, the starting point of the inference (a row vector);
- `LB` and `UB`, hard lower and upper bounds for the parameters;
- `PLB` and `PUB`, *plausible* lower and upper bounds, that is a box that ideally brackets a region of high posterior density.

The output parameters are:
- `VP`, a struct with the variational posterior approximating the true posterior;
- `ELBO`, the (estimated) lower bound on the log model evidence;
- `ELBO_SD`, the standard deviation of the estimate of the `ELBO` (*not* the error between the `ELBO` and the true log model evidence, which is generally unknown).

The variational posterior `vp` can be manipulated with functions such as `vbmc_moments` (compute posterior mean and covariance), `vbmc_pdf` (evaluates the posterior density), `vbmc_rnd` (draw random samples), `vbmc_kldiv` (Kullback-Leibler divergence between two posteriors), `vbmc_mtv` (marginal total variation distance between two posteriors); see also [this question](https://github.com/lacerbi/vbmc/wiki#what-is-vp-and-what-do-i-do-with-it).

### Next steps

### For BADS users

If you already use [Bayesian Adaptive Direct Search (BADS)](https://github.com/lacerbi/bads) to fit your models, setting up VBMC on your problem should be particularly simple; see [here](https://github.com/lacerbi/vbmc/wiki#i-already-run-bads-on-my-problem-how-do-i-run-vbmc).

## How does it work

VBMC combines two machine learning techniques in a novel way: 
- [variational inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_Bayesian_methods), a method to perform approximate Bayesian inference;
- Bayesian quadrature, a technique to estimate the value of expensive integrals.

VBMC iteratively builds an approximation of the true, expensive target posterior via a [Gaussian process](https://distill.pub/2019/visual-exploration-gaussian-processes/) (GP), and it matches a variational distribution — an expressive mixture of Gaussians — to the GP. 

This matching process entails optimization of the *evidence lower bound* (ELBO), that is a lower bound on the log marginal likelihood (LML), also known as log model evidence. Crucially, we estimate the ELBO via Bayesian quadrature, which is fast and does not require further evaluation of the true target posterior.

In each iteration, VBMC uses *active sampling* to select which points to evaluate next in order to explore the posterior landscape and reduce uncertainty in the approximation.

In the figure above, we show an example VBMC run on a "banana" function. The left panel shows the ground truth for the target posterior density. In the middle panel we show VBMC at work (contour plots of the variational posterior) across iterations. Red crosses are the centers of the mixture of Gaussians used as variational posterior, whereas dots are sampled points in the training set (*black*: previously sampled points, *blue*: points sampled in the current iteration). The right panel shows a plot of the estimated ELBO vs. the true log marginal likelihood (LML).

In the figure below, we show another example VBMC run on a "lumpy" distribution.

See the VBMC paper for more details [[1](#references)].

## VBMC with noisy likelihoods

VBMC v1.0 (June 2020) introduced support for noisy models [[2](#references)]. See the [presentations](#presentations) section below for recorded talks that discuss the new version of VBMC.
To run VBMC on a noisy problem, first you need to ensure that your target function `fun` returns:

- as first output, the noisy value of the log-posterior (where the noise usually comes from a stochastic evaluation of the log-likelihood);
- as second output, an estimate of the noise in the returned log-posterior value (expressed as standard deviation, SD).

Noisy evaluations of the log-likelihood often arise from simulation-based models, for which a direct expression of the (log) likelihood is not available. We recommend [Inverse Binomial Sampling](https://github.com/lacerbi/ibs) (IBS) as a method that conveniently computes both an unbiased estimate of the log-likelihood and an estimate of its variability entirely through simulation — however VBMC is compatible with any estimation technique.

Once you have set up `fun` as above, run VBMC by specifying that the target function is noisy
```
OPTIONS.SpecifyTargetNoise = true;
[VP,ELBO,ELBO_SD] = vbmc(FUN,X0,LB,UB,PLB,PUB,OPTIONS);
```

For more information, see the [VBMC FAQ](https://github.com/lacerbi/vbmc/wiki#noisy-target-function) and Example 5 in the [VBMC tutorial](https://github.com/lacerbi/vbmc/blob/master/vbmc_examples.m).

In the figure below, we show the difference in performance between the original VBMC (old) and VBMC v1.0 (new) when dealing with noisy target evaluations.

## Troubleshooting

The VBMC toolbox is under active development. The toolbox has been extensively tested in several benchmarks and published papers, but as with any approximate inference technique you need to double-check your results. See the FAQ for more information on [diagnostics](https://github.com/lacerbi/vbmc/wiki#troubleshooting).

If you have trouble doing something with VBMC, spot bugs or strange behavior, or you simply have some questions, please contact me at <luigi.acerbi@helsinki.fi>, putting 'VBMC' in the subject of the email.

## VBMC for other programming languages

VBMC is currently available only for MATLAB. We started working on a Python version in 2021 with support from the [Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence FCAI](https://fcai.fi/).

If you are interested in helping porting VBMC to Python or another language (R, [Julia](https://julialang.org/)), please get in touch.
However, before contacting me for this reason, please have a good look at the codebase here on GitHub, and at the papers [[1,2](#references)]. VBMC is a fairly complex piece of software, so be aware that porting it will require considerable effort and programming/computing skills.

## Presentations

Work related to VBMC has been presented at seminars in Oxford (UK), Bristol (UK), NYU (NY, USA), Helsinki (Finland), Brown University (RI, USA), NTNU (Trondheim, Norway), etc., and at several conferences. Recent presentations cover both VBMC papers (2018, 2020) and related work on simulator-based inference, with titles such as ``Practical sample-efficient Bayesian inference for models with and without likelihoods''.
