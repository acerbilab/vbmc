# Background to understand Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo (work in progress)

Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo (VBMC from now on) is a fairly complex algorithm that combines several machine learning ideas.
If you are not fully familiar with these basic concepts, understanding how VBMC works can be quite challenging. 
The goal of this document is to provide a quick reference to useful material to build the necessariy background knowledge to understand the principles behind VBMC.
